## HTML 

Html is the skeleton of the webpage. You are able to put your structure into place. It is easier to write your HTML after you create a wireframe. A wireframe is a bare bones mock up of the web page you want to design.
When making your wireframe make sure to keep your audience in mind, as they will be the main consumers of your content. 
A website is composed of a head, body. The head is seen by the coder and the body is the content your audience will see. 

Below are some common HTML terms

1. opening tag: This is the name of the element wrapped in open and closing brackets. <   p  >
2. closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag but instead looks like this <   /   p   >
3. content: Exactly what it says. This is the content of the element, this usually comes after the opening tag
4. element: an element is all the above combined.
