## Growth Mindset 
Growth Mindset is changing the way you think. It is discarding the idea that things are easier for others just because. Growth mindset requires you to work hard and free yourself of  self imposed limitations. It is acknowleding that talents, skills and intelligence are all things that can be accomplished with hard work and dedication.
