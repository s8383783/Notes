## About Me
My name is Shania Kimbrough. I am an army veteran with over 8 years experience as an analyst. I am from the great state of Texas, but Arizona is home for now. I currently work in Special/Personnel Security for soldiers on Ft. Huachuca.  My hobbies include watching horror movies, reading, and gaming. My favorite author is Stephen King and my favorite game currently is cyberpunk 2077. I recently became a mother and I couldn't be happier. I live at home with my husband, daughter, and two cats.

This page is for my reading notes. My reading notes will just be summaries of my readings put into my own words. 

## Growth Mindset 
Growth Mindset is changing the way you think. It is discarding the idea that things are easier for others just because. Growth mindset requires you to work hard and free yourself of  self imposed limitations. It is acknowleding that talents, skills and intelligence are all things that can be accomplished with hard work and dedication. 
In order to keep myself in the Growth mindset I will:
* Not compare myself to others
* Ask for help
* Take criticism in stride
> "The only thing that overcomes hard luck is hard  work."
