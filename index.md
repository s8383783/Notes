## About Me
* My name is Shania Kimbrough. I am an army veteran with over 8 years experience as an analyst. I am from the great state of Texas, but Arizona is home for now.
* I currently work in Special/Personnel Security for soldiers on Ft. Huachuca. 
* My hobbies include watching horror movies, reading, and gaming. My favorite author is Stephen King and my favorite game currently is cyberpunk 2077. I recently became a mother and I couldn't be happier. I live at home with my husband, daughter, and two cats.
