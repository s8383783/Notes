## CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a program that lets you make changes to your webpages. CSS is the decorative part of web design. It contains two components; properties and values. 
CSS syntax is pretty easy. THe flow of CSS syntax makes sense and makes it easy to follow. 
For example if I want to use inline CSS in a HTML document I would put the style element inside the HTML head. 
This is not the best way to write CSS as it can become very tedious and will make you HTML code harder to follow. 
The External stylesheet is the best option as it keeps your CSS and HTML separate and easier to read. You will need to tell the HTML doc where the CSS file is located. 
Selectors are used to pick out specific parts of HTML to edit. If you use multiple changes to the same selector it will pick the one on the bottom, as CSS reads top to bottom.
