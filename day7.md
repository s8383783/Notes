- You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

- `for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {`
- `// Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.`
- ` console.log('Walking east one step');`
- `}`
