# Day 1 notes

Markdown is an easy way to edit text. You can change text size, insert headers, link websites, and much more. The most important thing you need to understand about **Markdown is the syntax. 
Think of the syntax as a rule book. 

For example "the rule" to put something in italics is that it must start and finish with the star symbol (shift + 8). Another example, 
in order to make text into a header it must start with the hashtag symbol (shift + 3). 
**Markdown is simple to use and there are many cheat sheets out there detailing all the "rules".
