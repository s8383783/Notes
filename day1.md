Think of the syntax as a rule book. For example "the rules" to put something in italics is that it must start and finish with the star symbol (shift +8). Another example
In order to make test into a header it must start with the hashtag symbol ( shift+3). 
Markdown is simple to use and there are many cheat sheets out there detailing all the "rules".
