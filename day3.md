## Git
Git is system that stores data in snapshots. This system makes it easy for software developers to collaborate world wide and even without internet connection. 
Git is called a DVCS which stands for Distributed version control. This means that the system is not reliant on the server. This allows for user to create repositories to collaborate with other users.
You can access Git from your terminal, and can use it to clone your repository and push up your local changes.
To do this you must edit or create the file you want to add 
using the 'git add' command once al the files you want to add are green (you can see this by using the git status command) You are then ready to commit your changes using the git commit -m command. 
Then when that is all done you simply push your file up.
using git push origin gh-pages(or whatever brand your repository is located in)
